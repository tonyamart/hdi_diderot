281 (P.D.)","This Fragment appears both in P.D. and FP II. I extracted it from V-FP and H-FP, so now it can only be found in FP II files.
Duchet: ""C'est un passage de la p.201 qui vient de F.P. 8 et a été ajouté dans l'Histoire en 1774"". // Goggi: FP VIII à HDI (pour alinéa 3). 
Damien: there is an incoherence here: if it is an FP fragment, it cannot have appeared in 1770.
-SOLVED: See below



Fragment no. 243 consists of §2 and §3. Goggi writes that §3 is FP VIII. Therefore I suggest that §2 is P.D (or P.D. AND FP VIII). As Damien pointed out the appearance of FP in 1770 would make no sense, therefore I suggest P.D. is only §2. This paragraph (§2) was falsely assigned 
to be FP by me. Therefore I added §2 to another file so it could be readded to the H-FP and V-FP corpus if needed. Still it confuses me why 
these two paragraphs are put together as one fragment (no.243)?","yes"

Duchet writes: This passage is taken from the article ""sauvage"" from the ""L'Encyclopédie"" d'Yverdon. The chunks which come from FP were
added into H74 (21-22) ""de manière fragmentaire"". Goggi writes FP II à HDI (quelques lignes). On page 255 (Goggi) one can see that he suggests
that §1 has the passages from FP included. This means §2-§12 could be readded to H-FP and V-FP.
